I'm Marta, the oldest daughter after two mischievous brothers: Peter and Paul. I've come to the inescapable conclusion that they really believe that our living room is a forest or a circus, our sofa a tree or a trapeze, and they are essentially monkeys or flying acrobats who defy death, logic, and common sense.

Nearly a week ago, Mum was very busy and overwhelmed, even though she usually says that she is just very focused on what she is doing. Mum asked Dad, "Why don't you go to the park with the kids?"

Daddy sighed with resignation, "OK Mum. Kids, let's go to the park and have some fun!" "Awesome!", my brothers shouted in joy.  I was not so happy to say the least. I don't know what it's going on lately, but whatever that is, I feel very tired most of the time.
I am as exhausted as a marathon runner with his grandma riding his back.

We arrived there in the blink of an eye. "Let's play hide and seek at once because the end of days is near," exclaimed Peter with a burst of laughter. "You are worse than the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, corrupt politicians, greedy lawyers and drug-resistant superbugs all combined and intertwined without hesitation or good reason," I declared with authority and conviction.

We have just begun to play when Paul mocked at me saying, "You are running slower than a snake with diarrhea or a turtle on crutches." And I protested vehemently, "You are about as funny as a farting gift in a crowded elevator of a skyscraper." However, Peter insisted, "You are very clumsy like a bull in a china shop."

I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.
Don't ask me any questions, because I just might tell you the truth.
I am a pervert, but in a very romantic way

Did you parents lose a bet with an evil witch?
I can always count on you to relentlessly point out the negative.
My train of thought derailed. There were no survivors.
My decision making skills closely resemble that of a squirrel when crossing the street.
We’re all brave until we realize the cockroach has wing.
If you don’t want a sarcastic answer, don’t ask a stupid question.

“He comes. And he comes loaded with noise pollution. If I ever prayed for anything, it was for a man to shut up."

You deserve to be told you're beautiful every single day You deserve to be shown that you're loved in every single way. And my borrowed words are never enough to express how I feel about you
